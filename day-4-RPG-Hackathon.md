### Welcome C# Ninjas!!!

#### C# HACK-A-THON SONG
##### A totally original song by Adrien Dion
```
    Turn your computers on
    For a C# hack-a-thon
    It's a Dojo fun-a-thon
    Our C# hack-a-thon

    A hack-a-thon is
    a competition of code
    A team must finish their program
    before their heads explode

    We will be splitting
    Into teams of four
    What's that? You want more than that?
    Please add one more

    You must implement
    an interface
    And abstract is necessary
    to win this race

    You will have six hours to make your code bad-,
    load it up to git up and present it to the class!

    So turn your computers on
    Its a C# Hack-a-thon
    Form your team--thons
    and have a C#, C#, C#, C# Hack-a-thon

```
